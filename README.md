* [ctf_bypassed](#ctf_bypassed)


## `ctf_bypassed`

#### Title: Bypassed
#### Tagline: Opposing bases with a myriad of alternate paths and passages

This is a mostly faithful recreation of my old Bypass map from F.E.A.R., adapted and expanded for TF2.

Plenty of places to hide and (maybe too many) alternate paths between the intel and central room.
